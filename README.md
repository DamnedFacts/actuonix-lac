# actuonix-lac
Python module for controlling an Actuonix Linear Actuator Control Board (https://www.actuonix.com/LAC-Board-p/lac.htm).

Other APIs exist for these, but we made one anyways, and if I'm not mistaken it was good enough to be used in a
telescope owned by the University of Rochester in New York. Since then I've cleaned up the project a lot.
