Python module for controlling an Actuonix/Firgelli Linear Actuator Control Board (https://www.actuonix.com/LAC-Board-p/lac.htm).

There's *probably* other APIs out there for the same device, and they're *probaby* better than this one, and they're
*probably* written in C, but we made one anyways. Too bad we had to use Python instead of HolyC, but meh; it's fine
